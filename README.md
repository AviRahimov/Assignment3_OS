# Operating Systems Course: Assignment 3 - Proactor, Multi-Threads  using async I/O

## Overview

This assignment is a crucial part of the Operating Systems Course, aiming to enhance skills in multithreaded programming and the application of the proactor design pattern.
We are tasked with developing a chat server and client but under the constraints of a multithreaded environment without using asynchronous I/O.
The project unfolds in three sections: 
- creating a basic chat functionality in a multithreaded setup.
- implementing a general proactor pattern.
- finally integrating the proactor into the chat server.
  
This progression is designed to deepen understanding of handling multiple client connections, thread management, and event-driven programming,
culminating in a comprehensive exploration of advanced networking concepts within a Unix/Linux environment.
